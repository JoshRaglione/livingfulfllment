                </header>

                <p>Hello, üëã my name is Joshua Raglione, I am a <u>certified health and life coach</u>  student from HCI (Health Coach Institute) was born and raised in beautiful mountain/ city town Portland, Oregon. I have always been <u>health conscious</u> throughout my whole life I grew up playing many sports from track and field, football, basketball but it wasn't until my sophomore year that I started to understand the <u>power of food</u> how it can destroy us, heal us and our world! so I decided to go vegetarian, later transitioned to vegan in my senior year and I can safely say that the journey has been well worth it. So worth it in fact that I want to help the companies who have been helping our planet and I want you to know that <u>you are helping others by helping yourself</u> that's why I make it <u>my mission to donate 25% of proceeds to organic plant-based companies</u> to fight climate change, extreme water use, pollution, land use, commercial fishing. (destroys coral reefs, kill thousands of dolphins, sea turtles, sharks, and other ‚Äúbycatch‚Äù animals. Coastal fish farms release feces, antibiotics, parasites, and non-native fish into sensitive marine ecosystems.) let's all make a change that is for the better! #LivingFulfillment!</u>  </p>

                </header>

                <h4>Addiction</h4>
                <p>I am by no means a perfect human... I have <u>struggled with</u> a eating disorder of <u>bingeing and purging for</u> more than <u>6 years</u>. I wish I could give you a story of struggling with something much more stoic but some of our <u>biggest accomplishments in life are overcoming</u> the things that are taking away from it which in this case definitely was doing to me.</p>

                <h4>My Trigger</h4>
                <p>Pressure <u>to be something more then I was</u>. People held me to a high standard, alot of people in my life wanted me to do things that I would end up prusuing but later giving up because it wasnt my true self of who I wanted to be. The feeling of <u>eating gave me a false sense of accomplishment</u> even though I didnt know this at the time I had to do a deep self reflection of myself. <u>I read books, articles, watched videos and even went to classes</u>. Once I acquired all this <u>knowledge</u> I could see what was really causing this disorder and as I dug I found out <u>new tools</u> for myself and  <u>tricks that work better and better each day</u>, each day gets easier, I cant say it was an easy road or it completely goes away but <u>you wont look back and regret</u> the change and <u>if I can do it so can you!</u> </p>

                </header>

                <p>I had to <u>be a detective</u> to find and identify my true view of myself that I was encage with <u>I read books, took action, learned from mistakes, try new things, end unhealthy relationships, take time for myself, track myself, go to classes</u> and through all this I have learned a lot. I brought the underlying cause out that I held on to. I then put it in a light that shows that it has no power so I could reverse, change, and live my life without feeling life doesn't favor me. <u>I promise life does favor us all! It just all starts here.üß†</u></p>
